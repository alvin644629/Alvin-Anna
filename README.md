# CartoonCamera - Android MVP (Kotlin)

This is a minimal Android Studio project scaffold for a **CartoonCamera** app MVP.
It contains CameraX preview + TFLite inference scaffold and a simple SoundTouch wrapper placeholder.

**IMPORTANT**
- This is a scaffold/template — to run you must:
  1. Open the project in Android Studio (Electric Eel or newer).
  2. Place a compatible TFLite cartoonization model at:
     `app/src/main/assets/cartoon_model.tflite`
     (I recommend a lightweight AnimeGAN/CartoonGAN TFLite; see links below.)
  3. Set `minSdkVersion`/`compileSdk` to match your studio SDKs if needed.
  4. Build & run on a device (recommended) rather than emulator for CameraX + audio.

Links / model hints:
- AnimeGAN / AnimeGANv2 repositories on GitHub (search "AnimeGAN v2 TFLite") — convert to TFLite if needed.
- CartoonGAN / white-box cartoonization projects often include conversion notebooks.

This scaffold was auto-generated by ChatGPT as a runnable starting point. It purposefully keeps model & heavy native libs out (add them manually).

## GitHub Actions - Automated APK build

This scaffold now includes a GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/android-build.yml`.
To produce a signed release APK automatically via GitHub Actions:

1. Create a Java keystore locally:
   ```bash
   keytool -genkeypair -v -keystore signing.keystore -alias cartoonkey -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
   ```
   Save the keystore password, key alias, and key password securely.

2. Encode the keystore as base64 and add repository secrets (on GitHub):
   ```bash
   base64 signing.keystore > signing.keystore.base64
   # copy contents of signing.keystore.base64
   ```
   On GitHub: Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret
   - `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64` : (paste base64 content)
   - `KEY_ALIAS` : cartoonkey
   - `KEY_PASSWORD` : (your key password)
   - `STORE_PASSWORD` : (your keystore password)

3. Push the project to GitHub (main branch). The workflow will run and produce an artifact named `cartooncamera-apk` available from the Actions run page.

If you prefer to build locally, open the project in Android Studio and follow Build → Generate Signed Bundle/APK and use your `signing.keystore`.
